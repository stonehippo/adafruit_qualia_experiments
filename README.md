Sample [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org) code for the [Adafruit Qualia ESP32-S3](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5800) and [RGB-666 displays](https://www.adafruit.com/search?q=RGB-666+display).


## Notes

The Adafruit Qualia ESP32-S3 is a nifty connected dev board that's been set up to drive RGB-666 TTL-interface TFT displays. These are large and somewhat complex displays, at least relative to other TFTs that you can drive with a microcontroller.

Adafruit has several RGB-666 displays available, with and without capacitive touch capabilities.

## Resources

There are a couple of Adafruit guides that are must reads if you're going to be working with the Qualia board and RGB-666 displays:

- [Adafruit Qualia ESP32-S3 for RGB-666 Displays](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qualia-esp32-s3-for-rgb666-displays)
- [Simplifying Qualia CircuitPython Projects](https://learn.adafruit.com/simplifying-qualia-cirtcuitpython-projects)

The last guide is a great starting point for getting up and running quick, including sample code that can help you get your head around working with these displays.

Also, check out the docs for the Qualia library (build on [PortalBase](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/portalbase/en/latest/)), which is a must for simplifying working with the various RGB-666 displays Adafruit offers.
